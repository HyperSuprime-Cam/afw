 * @brief WarpedPsf: a class which combines an unwarped psf and a camera distortion
 *
 * If K_0(x,x') is the unwarped PSF, and f is the camera distortion, then the 
 * warped PSF is defined by
 *
 *   K(f(x),f(x')) = K_0(x,x')      (*)
 *
 * We linearize the camera distortion in the vicinity of the point where the
 * PSF is computed.  The definition (*) does not include the Jacobian of the
 * transformation, since the afw convention is that PSF's are normalized to
 * have integral 1 anyway.
 *
 * Note: In order to plug into a WarpedPsf, the undistorted Psf only needs to define
 * the virtuals clone() and doGetLocalKernel().
